-- Durable operation table for asynchronous provisioning mutations.
--
-- Target: PostgreSQL 13+ (Cloud SQL). gen_random_uuid() is built in from 13;
-- on 12 and below, `create extension pgcrypto` first.
--
--
-- RETENTION
--
-- The hot table holds a 24 hour resolution window by default, tunable per
-- deployment. It is range-partitioned by created_at with one partition per
-- day, so ageing data out is a DETACH/DROP rather than a bulk DELETE -- a
-- delete of that volume would leave the table bloated and vacuum chasing it.
--
-- Dropping a partition is gated on it containing zero non-terminal rows.
-- A PENDING or RUNNING row in a partition about to be dropped is an operation
-- the caller was promised an answer for, and dropping it destroys that answer
-- with no trace. Use drop_operations_partition(), which enforces the gate and
-- refuses rather than cascading.
--
-- Because the window is short, the hot table is not the forensic record.
-- Deployments that need payload-level audit MUST export attrs/result to GCS
-- before the partition ages out; after 24 hours the slim history row is all
-- that remains, and it deliberately carries no payload.
--
--
-- WHY THE PRIMARY KEY IS (id, created_at)
--
-- PostgreSQL requires every unique or primary key on a partitioned table to
-- include the partition key, so `id` alone cannot be the primary key here.
-- id is still globally unique in practice -- it is a v4 UUID -- and callers
-- address operations by id alone. The composite key is a storage-engine
-- requirement, not part of the addressing model.
